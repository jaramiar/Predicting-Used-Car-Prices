# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices
A supervised machine learning model built on multivariate linear regression, paired with an exploratory analysis.

For this project, my goal was constructing a machine learning model based on multivariate linear regression to predict the price of used cars. I was supplied with a dataset (source unknown) containing information of cars and their selling prices. The dataset also included the following: make/model, year, registration, body style, engine type, engine volume, and mileage. Python facilitated the data wrangling, making of exploratory visuals, as well as the training and testing of the linear model. I made use of R to carry out statistical assumption tests, and Tableau to create interactive dashboards for supplemental visual exploration. This work was completed as a Final Project for my data science certification from Entity Academy, facilitated by Woz-U.
