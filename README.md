# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices
A supervised machine learning model built on multivariate linear regression, paired with an exploratory analysis.

This project's objective involved constructing a machine learning model based on multivariate linear regression to predict the price of used cars. The supplied dataset (Kaggile, original source unknown) contains vehicles information and their selling prices: make/model, year, registration, body style, engine type, engine volume, and mileage. Data wrangling, exploratory analysis, training and testing for the model were completed with Pyhon. Statistical assumption tests were carried out with R, and Tableau to create interactive dashboards for supplemental visual exploration. This work was completed as a Final Project for the Data Science Certification from Entity Academy/Woz-U online learning platform.
