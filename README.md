# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices
A supervised machine learning model built on multivariate linear regression, paired with an exploratory analysis.

The objective for this project involved constructing a machine learning model based on multivariate linear regression to predict the price of used cars, based on a supplied dataset (source unknown) containing information of cars and their selling prices. The dataset also included the following: make/model, year, registration, body style, engine type, engine volume, and mileage. Python facilitated the data wrangling, the creation of of exploratory visuals, as well as the training and testing of the model. Statistical assumption tests were carried out with R, and Tableau to create interactive dashboards for supplemental visual exploration. This work was completed as a Final Project the Data Science certification from Entity Academy, facilitated by Woz-U.
